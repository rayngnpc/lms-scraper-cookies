## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   A modern web browser (for potential initial cookie gathering or understanding site structure if needed)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configuration (`config.yaml`):**
    *   Rename `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` (or create `config.yaml` from scratch).
    *   Open `config.yaml` and fill in your details:

    ```yaml
    lms:
      base_url: "https://your-lms-domain.com" # e.g., https://canvas.instructure.com, https://moodle.yourschool.edu
      username: "YOUR_LMS_USERNAME"
      password: "YOUR_LMS_PASSWORD" # Consider using environment variables for sensitive data

    scraper_settings:
      download_path: "./LMS_Downloads" # Where to save downloaded files
      courses_to_scrape: # Optional: list specific course IDs or names if not scraping all
        - "CourseID1"
        - "Course Name 2"
      scrape_announcements: true
      scrape_materials: true
      scrape_grades: false # Be cautious with this feature

    # Optional: VirusTotal Configuration (if feature is implemented)
    # virustotal:
    #   api_key: "YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY" # Can also be set as an environment variable VT_API_KEY

    # Optional: Other settings
    # delay_between_requests: 2 # seconds, to be respectful to the server
    ```
    **Security Note:** For passwords and API keys, consider using environment variables or a `.env` file (add `.env` to `.gitignore`) instead of hardcoding them directly in `config.yaml` for better security.

## üöÄ Usage

Once configured, you can run the scraper from the command line:

```bash
python your_main_script_name.py [options]
Use code with caution.
Markdown
Common Operations:
Scrape all configured data:
python your_main_script_name.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Only download materials:
python your_main_script_name.py --materials-only
Use code with caution.
Bash
Only check announcements:
python your_main_script_name.py --announcements-only
Use code with caution.
Bash
Specify target courses (if not in config or to override):
python your_main_script_name.py --courses "CourseID1" "Another Course Name"
Use code with caution.
Bash
Get help on available commands:
python your_main_script_name.py --help
Use code with caution.
Bash
(You'll need to implement argument parsing using argparse in your Python script for these command-line options.)
üìÑ Output
The script will typically:
Create a main download directory (e.g., LMS_Downloads/) as specified in config.yaml.
Inside, create subdirectories for each course.
Further organize materials by type (e.g., Lectures/, Assignments/, Readings/).
(If implemented) Generate CSV reports (e.g., announcements_report.csv, download_log.csv) in the output directory or a dedicated reports folder.
Example Directory Structure:
LMS_Downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Course Name 1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lectures/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ week1.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ week2.pptx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Readings/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ article1.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Course Name 2/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignments/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assignment_spec.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ announcements_report.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ download_log.csv
Use code with caution.

This README was generated with care. Adapt and enhance it to best suit your project!
**Key things to customize:**

1.  **`[Your Project Name]`**: Give your scraper a cool or descriptive name.
2.  **`YourUsername/YourRepositoryName`**: Update all GitHub links.
3.  **`your_main_script_name.py`**: Replace with the actual name of your main Python script.
4.  **LMS Specifics**: If your scraper is tailored to a specific LMS (e.g., Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard), mention it and adjust configuration examples accordingly.
5.  **Features**: Add or remove features based on what your scraper actually does.
6.  **Configuration (`config.yaml` section)**: Ensure the example reflects your actual config structure.
7.  **Usage**: If you implement command-line arguments with `argparse`, update the examples.
8.  **Output**: Describe the actual output and directory structure your script creates.
9.  **License Badge & File**: If you add a license, make sure the `LICENSE` file exists in your repo.
10. **Demo GIF/Image**: If you can create a short visual, it really helps!

This more detailed and structured README should make your project much more approachable and professional on GitHub!
